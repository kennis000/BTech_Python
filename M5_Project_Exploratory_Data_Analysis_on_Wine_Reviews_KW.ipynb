        "To pick a truly great wine, consider those from England, India, Austria, or certain regions in France.\n",

        "\n",
        "Look for wines with 'depth', be wary of wines that are 'herbal', and be a little cautious of 'fruity' wines. Avoid wines with 'depth' that are both 'herbal' and 'fruity' - We're not looking for a trifecta on these aspects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The more expensive wines are not always better rated wines, so don't jump to that conclusion.\n",

        "\n",
        "If the wine taster gave a lengthy description, that may be an indicator of quality. And, if you find that Alexander Peartree wrote the review, consider padding its score with another point or two, he may be a little stingy with the points he awards.\n",
